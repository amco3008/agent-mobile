# Skill Manager

This skill manages the **dynamic skill learning and generation system**. It enables automatic skill creation from usage patterns, version control, and auto-improvement.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Pattern Observation** - Hooks capture tool usage and prompt patterns
2. **Skill Learning** - Analyze patterns to generate skill candidates
3. **Version Control** - Git-based versioning with rollback
4. **Auto-Improvement** - Automatically enhance skills based on effectiveness

## Commands

All commands use the manage.py CLI:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py <command> [args]
```

### List All Skills

Show installed skills with status and effectiveness scores:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py list
```

### Learn from Patterns

Analyze collected patterns and generate skill candidates:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py learn
```

### Show Candidates

List pending skill candidates awaiting approval:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py candidates
```

### Approve a Skill

Approve a candidate skill for use:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py approve <candidate-id>
```

### Reject a Skill

Reject and remove a candidate skill:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py reject <candidate-id>
```

### View Skill History

Show version history for a skill:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py history <skill-name>
```

### Rollback Skill Version

Restore a skill to a previous version:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py rollback <skill-name> <version>
```

### View Statistics

Show usage analytics and effectiveness metrics:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py stats
```

### Force Auto-Improvement

Trigger improvement analysis for a specific skill:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py improve <skill-name>
```

### Refine a Skill

Interactively improve a skill with new patterns:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/_skill-manager/scripts/manage.py refine <skill-name>
```

## How Pattern Learning Works

### 1. Observation Phase

Hooks automatically capture:
- **Tool sequences** - Which tools are used in what order
- **Domain keywords** - DevOps, security, frontend, etc.
- **Success/failure signals** - Task completion, errors, retries

### 2. Analysis Phase

The learning engine detects:
- **Repeated workflows** - Same tool chains used 2+ times
- **Domain expertise** - Concentration of domain-specific keywords
- **Reusable patterns** - Generalizable processes

### 3. Scoring Phase

Candidates are scored on:
| Factor | Weight | Criteria |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Frequency | 30% | Pattern appears 2+ times |
| Complexity | 20% | 3-7 tool steps optimal |
| Domain clarity | 25% | Clear domain association |
| Distinctiveness | 25% | Different from existing skills |

### 4. Generation Phase

High-scoring patterns become skill packages with:
- `SKILL.md` - Definition with YAML frontmatter
- `skill.meta.json` - Metadata and effectiveness tracking
- `references/` - Extracted documentation
- `scripts/` - Helper utilities (if applicable)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history

## Auto-Improvement System

Skills automatically improve when:
1. **Success rate drops below 70%**
2. **New enhancing patterns detected**
3. **50+ usages since last improvement**
4. **User manually refines skill** (system learns from refinement)

### Improvement Actions

- Add missing tool permissions
- Update reference documentation
- Add error handling for failure cases
- Refine trigger phrases
- Optimize workflow steps

### Confidence-Based Application

| Confidence | Action |
|------------|--------|
| ≥90% | Auto-apply improvement |
| 70-89% | Queue for user approval |
| <70% | Suggest but don't queue |

## Version Control

Each skill is a Git repository supporting:

```bash
# View version history
cd ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>
git log --oneline

# Compare versions
git diff v1.0.0 v1.1.0

# Rollback
git checkout v1.0.0
```

## Configuration

Edit `~/.claude/skills/.skill-system/config.json`:

```json
{
  "observation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "pattern_retention_days": 90
  },
  "learning": {
    "auto_suggest": true,
    "min_frequency": 2,
    "score_threshold": 0.6
  },
  "improvement": {
    "enabled": true,
    "auto_apply_threshold": 0.9,
    "min_usage_before_improve": 10,
    "success_rate_trigger": 0.7
  }
}
```

## Supported Domains

Pre-configured domain detection:
- **devops** - docker, kubernetes, ci/cd, terraform
- **security** - audit, vulnerability, owasp, encryption
- **data_science** - pandas, numpy, model, tensorflow
- **frontend** - react, vue, css, webpack
- **backend** - api, rest, database, orm
- **git** - merge, rebase, pr, branch

Custom domains can be added in config.

## Data Storage

| Location | Contents | Persistence |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `.skill-system/patterns/` | Raw observations | 90 days |
| `.skill-system/candidates/` | Pending approvals | Until approved/rejected |
| `.skill-system/config.json` | Configuration | Permanent |
| `<skill-name>/` | Active skills | Git-versioned |

## Example Workflow

1. **Normal usage** - Hooks observe patterns automatically
2. **Run learn** - `manage.py learn` analyzes patterns
3. **Review candidates** - `manage.py candidates` shows suggestions
4. **Approve** - `manage.py approve docker-compose-helper`
5. **Use skill** - Skill is now active and tracking effectiveness
6. **Auto-improve** - System enhances based on usage data

## Troubleshooting

### Hooks not capturing

Check hooks are registered:
```bash
cat ~/.claude/settings.local.json | grep -A5 hooks
```

### No candidates generated

Ensure sufficient pattern data:
```bash
wc -l ~/.claude/skills/.skill-system/patterns/*.jsonl
```

### Skill not improving

Check effectiveness metrics:
```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/skill.meta.json | jq .effectiveness
```
