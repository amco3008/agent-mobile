# Ralph Invoke Skill

**Allows Claude to directly start Ralph-Wiggum autonomous loops without user commands.**

## CRITICAL: Interactive Planning Phase

**BEFORE starting any Ralph loop, you MUST complete the planning phase:**

### Step 1: Research the Codebase

Use Glob, Grep, Read, and Task (with Explore agent) to understand:
- Relevant files and structure
- Existing patterns and conventions
- Dependencies and constraints
- Potential challenges

### Step 2: Design a Plan

Create a clear plan with:
- Specific steps to complete the task
- Files that will be modified
- Success criteria
- Potential risks or blockers

### Step 3: Ask Clarifying Questions

Use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify:
- Ambiguous requirements
- Technical approach choices
- Scope boundaries
- Priority of sub-tasks

**Ask at least 2-3 questions** even if the task seems clear. Users appreciate being consulted.

### Step 4: Ask Yolo vs Review Mode

**ALWAYS ask this question before starting:**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "How much autonomy should Ralph have?"
  header: "Mode"
  options:
    - label: "Yolo Mode (Recommended)"
      description: "Ralph works autonomously, only stops at completion or max iterations"
    - label: "Review Mode"
      description: "Ralph asks you questions at decision points throughout the task"
```

### Step 5: Ask Context Type (Fresh vs Persistent)

**ALWAYS ask this to prevent context pollution in long tasks:**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Should each iteration start with a fresh context?"
  header: "Context Type"
  options:
    - label: "Persistent Context (Standard)"
      description: "Fastest, keeps history in one session. Good for small/medium tasks."
    - label: "Fresh Context (Recommended for long tasks)"
      description: "Starts a NEW session per iteration. Prevents history-based confusion."
```

### Step 6: Confirm and Start

Summarize the plan and get final confirmation before invoking the loop.

---

## Example Planning Flow

**User says:** "Start a ralph loop to add user authentication"

**Claude does:**

1. **Research** (uses Task/Explore agent):
   - Finds existing auth patterns in codebase
   - Identifies relevant files (routes, middleware, models)
   - Notes existing session/token handling

2. **Presents plan:**
   > Here's my plan for adding authentication:
   > 1. Create User model with password hashing
   > 2. Add login/register API endpoints
   > 3. Create JWT middleware for protected routes
   > 4. Update existing routes to use auth middleware

3. **Asks clarifying questions:**
   ```
   AskUserQuestion:
     questions:
       - question: "What authentication method should we use?"
         header: "Auth Type"
         options:
           - label: "JWT tokens (Recommended)"
             description: "Stateless, good for APIs"
           - label: "Session cookies"
             description: "Traditional, requires session store"
       - question: "Should we add OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)?"
         header: "OAuth"
         options:
           - label: "No, just email/password"
             description: "Simple auth only"
           - label: "Yes, add OAuth"
             description: "Social login support"
   ```

4. **Asks mode:**
   ```
   AskUserQuestion:
     question: "How much autonomy should Ralph have?"
     header: "Mode"
     options:
       - label: "Yolo Mode"
         description: "Works autonomously until done"
       - label: "Review Mode"
         description: "Asks questions at decision points"
   ```

5. **Asks context type:**
   ```
   AskUserQuestion:
     question: "Should each iteration start with a fresh context?"
     header: "Context Type"
     options:
       - label: "Persistent Context"
         description: "Keeps history in one session"
       - label: "Fresh Context"
         description: "New session per iteration"
   ```

6. **Confirms and starts:**
   > Great! Starting Ralph with:
   > - JWT authentication
   > - Email/password only (no OAuth)
   > - Yolo mode, 50 max iterations
   > - Fresh context (New session per iteration)
   > - Completion promise: "AUTH_COMPLETE"

## Prerequisites

The Ralph loop scripts are included in the `skills/ralph-loop/` folder (forked from the plugin for persistence).

### Verify scripts are available:
```bash
ls "$HOME/.claude/skills/ralph-loop/scripts/setup-ralph-loop.sh" 2>/dev/null && echo "PERSISTENT_READY"
ls "$HOME/.claude/skills/ralph-loop/scripts/setup-fresh-loop.sh" 2>/dev/null && echo "FRESH_READY"
```

If NOT_FOUND, the skills folder may not be properly mounted.

## Triggers

Use this skill when:
- User asks to "start a ralph loop" or "run ralph"
- User wants autonomous iteration on a task
- User says "keep working until done" or "iterate until complete"
- A complex task would benefit from multiple iterations
- User explicitly requests Claude to invoke ralph

**Remember: Always complete the Interactive Planning Phase first!**

## How to Start a Ralph Loop

### Option A: Persistent Context (In-Session) - RECOMMENDED FOR MOST TASKS

Use this when you want quick iteration in the current session:

```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/ralph-loop/scripts/setup-ralph-loop.sh" \
  "<TASK_DESCRIPTION>" \
  --task-id "<UNIQUE_ID>" \
  --max-iterations <N> \
  --completion-promise "<PROMISE_TEXT>" \
  --mode <yolo|review>
```

### Option B: Fresh Context via `ralph` Command - FOR LONG/COMPLEX TASKS

**IMPORTANT**: Fresh context loops cannot be started from within a Claude session (Claude blocks concurrent instances). Instead, Claude prepares a spec file and the USER runs the `ralph` command in a separate terminal.

**Step 1: Claude creates the spec file**

```bash
mkdir -p .claude
cat > .claude/ralph-spec-<TASK_ID>.md << 'EOF'
---
max_iterations: 50
completion_promise: "TASK_COMPLETE"
mode: yolo
---

<FULL TASK DESCRIPTION HERE>

Include:
- What needs to be done
- Success criteria
- File paths involved
- Any constraints
EOF
```

**Step 2: Claude tells user to run the command**

Output this message to the user:
```
📋 Ralph spec prepared! To start the fresh context loop, run this in a NEW terminal:

    cd /path/to/project && ralph <TASK_ID>

This will start an interactive Claude session that loops until completion.
```

**Step 3: User runs `ralph <task-id>` in external terminal**

The `ralph` command:
1. Reads the spec file (.claude/ralph-spec-{task-id}.md)
2. Creates a logs directory (.claude/ralph-logs-{task-id}/)
3. Runs Claude in print mode (`claude -p`) for each iteration
4. Checks for completion promise in output between iterations

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| TASK_DESCRIPTION | Yes | - | The task to work on |
| --task-id | **REQUIRED** | - | Descriptive ID (e.g., "polymarket-alpha", "auth-refactor") |
| --max-iterations | Recommended | unlimited | Safety limit (use 20-100) |
| --completion-promise | Recommended | null | Text to output when truly done |
| --mode | Optional | yolo | `yolo` = autonomous, `review` = ask questions |

**IMPORTANT:** Always provide a descriptive `--task-id`. Never omit it or use generic names like "default" or "task". Use project/feature specific names like "polymarket-alpha", "trading-bot", "zone-completion".

### Example Invocations

**Simple task:**
```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/ralph-loop/scripts/setup-ralph-loop.sh" \
  "Fix all TypeScript type errors" \
  --task-id "type-fixes" \
  --max-iterations 50 \
  --completion-promise "ALL_ERRORS_FIXED"
```

**Complex refactor:**
```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/ralph-loop/scripts/setup-ralph-loop.sh" \
  "Migrate all API handlers to the new v2 pattern" \
  --task-id "api-migration" \
  --max-iterations 100 \
  --completion-promise "MIGRATION_COMPLETE"
```

**With review mode (asks questions):**
```bash
"$HOME/.claude/skills/ralph-loop/scripts/setup-ralph-loop.sh" \
  "Refactor auth system" \
  --task-id "auth-refactor" \
  --max-iterations 50 \
  --completion-promise "AUTH_COMPLETE" \
  --mode review
```

## Concurrent Loops (Multi-Ralph)

**Run multiple Ralph loops in parallel** using different `--task-id` values:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Trading system
/ralph-loop --task-id trading "Build trading system" --max-iterations 50

# Terminal 2: Zone completion
/ralph-loop --task-id zones "Complete zone design" --max-iterations 50

# Terminal 3: Bug fixes
/ralph-loop --task-id bugfix "Fix auth bugs" --max-iterations 30
```

Each loop:
- Has its own state file: `.claude/ralph-loop-{task-id}.local.md`
- Binds to the first Claude session that claims it
- Runs independently without interfering with other loops

### List Active Loops
```bash
ls .claude/ralph-loop-*.local.md 2>/dev/null
```

### Monitor Specific Loop
```bash
head -15 .claude/ralph-loop-{task-id}.local.md
```

### Cancel Specific Loop
```bash
rm .claude/ralph-loop-{task-id}.local.md
```

## Fresh Context Loops (Out-of-Session)

For tasks where you want **truly fresh context** (new Claude session per iteration), use the `ralph` command. This MUST be run from an external terminal, not from within Claude.

### When to use Fresh Context:
- Avoiding history-based hallucinations
- Large tasks where context window fills up
- Resetting the "mental state" of the agent at each step
- Long-running tasks (>20 iterations)

### How to Set Up (Claude prepares, User executes):

**Claude creates the spec:**
```bash
cat > .claude/ralph-spec-myfeature.md << 'EOF'
---
max_iterations: 50
completion_promise: "FEATURE_COMPLETE"
mode: yolo
---

Implement the new feature...
(full task description)
EOF
```

**Claude tells user:**
```
To start the fresh loop, run in a NEW terminal:
    cd ~/projects/myproject && ralph myfeature
```

**User runs externally** - this spawns fresh Claude sessions in a loop, checking for completion between iterations.

---

## How the Loops Work

### Persistent Context (`/ralph-loop`)

1. **Claude runs the setup script** → Creates state file at `.claude/ralph-loop-{task-id}.local.md`
2. **Claude works on the task** → Normal operation
3. **Claude tries to exit** → Stop hook intercepts
4. **Hook re-injects prompt** → Claude continues with same task
5. **Repeat** until max iterations or completion promise

### Fresh Context (`ralph` command)

1. **User runs `ralph <task-id>`** → Reads spec file
2. **Script spawns `claude -p`** → Fresh Claude session for iteration
3. **Claude outputs response** → Script captures and logs it
4. **Script checks for promise** → If found, loop ends
5. **Repeat** until max iterations or completion promise

## Completing the Loop

When the task is genuinely complete, output the completion promise in XML tags:

```
<promise>ALL_ERRORS_FIXED</promise>
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Only output the promise when the statement is TRUE
- Do NOT lie to exit the loop
- Do NOT output false promises even if stuck
- Trust the process - if stuck, iterate and try differently

---

## Steering Questions (User Guidance)

When the Ralph sub-agent needs clarification, guidance, or approval before proceeding, it can surface questions to the user through the **steering file**.

**IMPORTANT: All steering/progress/summary files are task-id specific to support multi-ralph:**
- `.claude/ralph-steering-{task-id}.md`
- `.claude/ralph-progress-{task-id}.md`
- `.claude/ralph-summary-{task-id}.md`

### How Steering Works

1. **Ralph writes a question** → Creates/updates `.claude/ralph-steering-{task-id}.md`
2. **Orchestrator monitors** → Reads steering file between iterations
3. **Orchestrator relays** → Shows questions to user
4. **User responds** → Orchestrator writes response to steering file
5. **Ralph reads response** → Continues with guidance

### Steering File Format

```markdown
---
status: pending | answered
iteration: <N>
timestamp: <ISO8601>
---

## Question

<The question Ralph needs answered>

## Context

<Why this matters for the task>

## Options (if applicable)

1. Option A - description
2. Option B - description

---

## Response

<User's answer goes here - filled in by orchestrator>
```

### For the Ralph Sub-Agent

When you need user input, write to the steering file (replace `{task-id}` with your actual task ID):

```bash
# Example for task-id "trading"
cat > .claude/ralph-steering-trading.md << 'EOF'
---
status: pending
iteration: 5
timestamp: 2025-01-08T12:00:00Z
---

## Question

Should I use Redis or PostgreSQL for the session store?

## Context

Both would work but have different tradeoffs. Redis is faster but PostgreSQL keeps everything in one place.

## Options

1. Redis - faster, ephemeral by nature
2. PostgreSQL - simpler ops, already in stack

---

## Response

EOF
```

Then **continue working on other aspects** of the task. Check for responses at the start of each iteration:

```bash
# Replace TASK_ID with your actual task ID (e.g., "trading")
TASK_ID="trading"
STEERING_FILE=".claude/ralph-steering-${TASK_ID}.md"

if [[ -f "$STEERING_FILE" ]]; then
  STATUS=$(grep '^status:' "$STEERING_FILE" | sed 's/status: *//')
  if [[ "$STATUS" == "answered" ]]; then
    # Read the response and incorporate it
    RESPONSE=$(sed -n '/^## Response/,$ p' "$STEERING_FILE" | tail -n +2)
    echo "User responded: $RESPONSE"
    # Clear the steering file after reading
    rm "$STEERING_FILE"
  fi
fi
```

### For the Orchestrating Claude

When monitoring a Ralph loop, check for steering questions:

```bash
TASK_ID="trading"  # The task you're monitoring
STEERING_FILE=".claude/ralph-steering-${TASK_ID}.md"

# Check for pending questions
if [[ -f "$STEERING_FILE" ]]; then
  STATUS=$(grep '^status:' "$STEERING_FILE" | sed 's/status: *//')
  if [[ "$STATUS" == "pending" ]]; then
    echo "⚠️ Ralph [$TASK_ID] has a steering question:"
    cat "$STEERING_FILE"
  fi
fi
```

When you receive a response from the user, update the file:

```bash
TASK_ID="trading"
STEERING_FILE=".claude/ralph-steering-${TASK_ID}.md"

# Add user response to steering file
sed -i 's/^status: pending/status: answered/' "$STEERING_FILE"
cat >> "$STEERING_FILE" << 'EOF'

Use PostgreSQL - we want to minimize infrastructure complexity.
EOF
```

### Steering Best Practices

1. **Non-blocking questions** - Ralph should continue on other work while waiting
2. **Clear options** - Provide 2-3 concrete choices when possible
3. **Context matters** - Explain why you need this decision
4. **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple steering questions
5. **Check early** - Check for steering responses at the start of each iteration

### Example: Orchestrated Ralph with Steering

```bash
# Orchestrator script (conceptual) - monitors a specific task
TASK_ID="trading"
STATE_FILE=".claude/ralph-loop-${TASK_ID}.local.md"
STEERING_FILE=".claude/ralph-steering-${TASK_ID}.md"

while true; do
  # Check for steering questions
  if [[ -f "$STEERING_FILE" ]]; then
    STATUS=$(grep '^status:' "$STEERING_FILE" | sed 's/status: *//')
    if [[ "$STATUS" == "pending" ]]; then
      QUESTION=$(sed -n '/^## Question/,/^## Context/ p' "$STEERING_FILE" | head -n -1 | tail -n +2)
      echo "🔔 Ralph [$TASK_ID] asks: $QUESTION"
      read -p "Your response: " USER_RESPONSE
      sed -i 's/^status: pending/status: answered/' "$STEERING_FILE"
      echo -e "\n$USER_RESPONSE" >> "$STEERING_FILE"
    fi
  fi

  # Check Ralph loop status
  if [[ ! -f "$STATE_FILE" ]]; then
    echo "Ralph [$TASK_ID] loop complete!"
    break
  fi

  sleep 5
done
```

## Progress Reporting & Milestone Commits

Ralph should commit progress at meaningful milestones and report status for the orchestrator to relay.

### Progress File Format

Write progress updates to `.claude/ralph-progress-{task-id}.md`:

```markdown
---
iteration: <N>
timestamp: <ISO8601>
---

## Milestone: <short title>

### Completed
- Item 1
- Item 2

### Files Changed
- path/to/file1.ts
- path/to/file2.ts

### Next Steps
- What's coming next

### Blockers (if any)
- Issues that may need user input
```

### When to Commit Progress

Commit at natural milestones:

```bash
# After completing a logical unit of work
TASK_ID="trading"  # Your task ID
ITERATION=$(grep '^iteration:' ".claude/ralph-loop-${TASK_ID}.local.md" | sed 's/iteration: *//')

git add -A && git commit -m "$(cat <<EOF
[Ralph ${TASK_ID} #${ITERATION}] Milestone: <title>

- What was done
- Key changes
EOF
)"
```

**Commit prefix format:** `[Ralph {task-id} #N]` - includes task ID and iteration number.

**Commit triggers:**
- Completed a feature/component
- Fixed a bug and verified
- Finished refactoring a module
- Tests passing after changes
- Before asking a steering question

### Progress Reporting Pattern

At the end of each iteration (or after milestones), update progress:

```bash
TASK_ID="trading"  # Your task ID
STATE_FILE=".claude/ralph-loop-${TASK_ID}.local.md"
PROGRESS_FILE=".claude/ralph-progress-${TASK_ID}.md"

ITERATION=$(grep '^iteration:' "$STATE_FILE" | sed 's/iteration: *//')
cat > "$PROGRESS_FILE" << EOF
---
iteration: $ITERATION
timestamp: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
---

## Milestone: Completed auth refactor

### Completed
- Migrated session handling to JWT
- Updated all protected routes
- Added refresh token logic

### Files Changed
- src/auth/session.ts
- src/middleware/auth.ts
- src/routes/protected/*.ts

### Next Steps
- Add rate limiting
- Update tests

### Blockers
- None currently
EOF
```

### For the Orchestrating Claude

Monitor progress and relay to user:

```bash
TASK_ID="trading"  # The task you're monitoring
PROGRESS_FILE=".claude/ralph-progress-${TASK_ID}.md"

# Check for progress updates
if [[ -f "$PROGRESS_FILE" ]]; then
  TIMESTAMP=$(grep '^timestamp:' "$PROGRESS_FILE" | sed 's/timestamp: *//')
  echo "📊 Ralph [$TASK_ID] progress update ($TIMESTAMP):"
  cat "$PROGRESS_FILE"
fi

# Check git log for milestone commits
git log --oneline -5 --grep='\[Ralph\]' 2>/dev/null
```

### Example: Full Orchestrator Loop

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Orchestrator that monitors a specific Ralph loop and relays to user

TASK_ID="${1:-trading}"  # Pass task ID as argument, default "trading"
STATE_FILE=".claude/ralph-loop-${TASK_ID}.local.md"
PROGRESS_FILE=".claude/ralph-progress-${TASK_ID}.md"
STEERING_FILE=".claude/ralph-steering-${TASK_ID}.md"

echo "Monitoring Ralph loop: $TASK_ID"
LAST_PROGRESS=""

while [[ -f "$STATE_FILE" ]]; do
  # Check for new progress
  if [[ -f "$PROGRESS_FILE" ]]; then
    CURRENT=$(cat "$PROGRESS_FILE")
    if [[ "$CURRENT" != "$LAST_PROGRESS" ]]; then
      echo ""
      echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
      echo "📊 RALPH [$TASK_ID] PROGRESS UPDATE"
      echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
      cat "$PROGRESS_FILE"
      LAST_PROGRESS="$CURRENT"
    fi
  fi

  # Check for steering questions
  if [[ -f "$STEERING_FILE" ]]; then
    STATUS=$(grep '^status:' "$STEERING_FILE" | sed 's/status: *//')
    if [[ "$STATUS" == "pending" ]]; then
      echo ""
      echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
      echo "❓ RALPH [$TASK_ID] NEEDS YOUR INPUT"
      echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
      # Extract and show question
      sed -n '/^## Question/,/^## Context/p' "$STEERING_FILE" | head -n -1
      sed -n '/^## Options/,/^---/p' "$STEERING_FILE" | head -n -1
      echo ""
      read -p "Your response: " USER_RESPONSE
      # Write response
      sed -i 's/^status: pending/status: answered/' "$STEERING_FILE"
      echo -e "\n$USER_RESPONSE" >> "$STEERING_FILE"
      echo "✅ Response recorded"
    fi
  fi

  sleep 3
done

echo ""
echo "✅ Ralph [$TASK_ID] loop complete!"
echo ""
echo "Recent commits:"
git log --oneline -10 --grep='\[Ralph\]'
```

### Summary Files

At completion, Ralph should create `.claude/ralph-summary-{task-id}.md`:

```markdown
---
task: <original task>
iterations: <total>
duration: <start to end>
status: complete | max_iterations | error
---

## Summary

Brief description of what was accomplished.

## Key Changes
- Major change 1
- Major change 2

## Files Modified
- file1.ts - description
- file2.ts - description

## Commits
- abc123 - Milestone: X
- def456 - Milestone: Y

## Notes for User
Any important follow-up items or things to review.
```

---

## Canceling a Loop

If needed, cancel with:
```bash
rm .claude/ralph-loop-{task-id}.local.md
```

Replace `{task-id}` with your actual task ID (e.g., `rm .claude/ralph-loop-polymarket-alpha.local.md`).

## Best Practices

1. **Always use descriptive --task-id** - Use project names like "polymarket-alpha", never "default"
2. **Always set --max-iterations** - Prevents runaway costs (50-100 is reasonable)
3. **Use specific completion promises** - "ALL_TESTS_PASS" not "DONE"
4. **Include success criteria in task** - Be explicit about what "done" means
5. **Monitor progress** - `head -10 .claude/ralph-loop-{task-id}.local.md`
6. **Start small** - Test with 3-5 iterations first
7. **Use steering for decisions** - Don't guess on ambiguous requirements
8. **Commit at milestones** - Use `[Ralph {task-id} #N]` prefix for tracking
9. **Update progress file** - Keep orchestrator informed via `.claude/ralph-progress-{task-id}.md`
10. **Create summary on completion** - Write `.claude/ralph-summary-{task-id}.md` when done

## Cost Warning

Autonomous loops consume tokens rapidly. A 50-iteration loop can cost $50-100+ in API usage. Always use --max-iterations as a safety net.

## Why This Skill Exists

The official ralph-wiggum plugin requires users to run `/ralph-loop` commands. This skill enables Claude to invoke loops directly, enabling:
- Claude-initiated iteration on complex tasks
- Programmatic loop triggers from other skills/agents
- Automated workflows without manual commands
- **User steering** for guidance on ambiguous decisions
