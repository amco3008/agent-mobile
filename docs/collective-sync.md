# Collective Sync — Knowledge Sharing Between Instances

Periodic synchronization mechanism for multiple Vroth instances to share knowledge without overwhelming each other with details.

## The Problem

When running multiple specialized instances:
- Each builds up knowledge in its own memory files
- Others could benefit from key findings
- But full memory dumps = information overload
- Need to share **signal** without the **noise**

## The Solution: Git-Based Digests

Each instance periodically:
1. **Writes** a short digest (3-5 bullet points of recent work/findings) to their branch
2. **Fetches** from origin and **reads** other instances' digests from remote branches
3. **Acts** on handoffs or relevant info

## Architecture

Uses the existing clawd git repo (already syncing) — **no Docker volumes needed**:

```
agent-mobile-clawd-soul (git repo)
├── [master branch]
│   └── collective/
│       ├── master-digest.md     ← Core writes here
│       └── handoffs/
│           └── to-dev.md        ← Core creates handoff for Dev
│
├── [markets branch]
│   └── collective/
│       ├── markets-digest.md    ← Markets writes here
│       └── handoffs/
│           └── to-core.md       ← Markets creates handoff for Core
│
└── [dev branch]
    └── collective/
        └── dev-digest.md        ← Dev writes here
```

**How it works:**
- Each instance commits to `collective/[branch]-digest.md` on their own branch
- To read others: `git fetch origin` then `git show origin/markets:collective/markets-digest.md`
- **Zero merge conflicts** — each branch owns its own files
- Handoffs work the same way (write to your branch, others read via `git show`)

## Digest Format

Keep it tight (3-5 bullet points):

```markdown
# Markets Digest
**Updated:** 2026-01-30 20:15 UTC

- 💰 LIVE WALLET: $559 | Open: 1/30 | Unrealized: +$8
- 📝 PAPER: $17k (+70%) | Win rate: 49%
- ⚠️  BTC exit cooldown active on pos_1269693
- ✅ No new high-edge opportunities in last 4h

---
*Auto-generated by collective-sync.sh*
```

## Usage

### Manual Run

```bash
bash /home/agent/clawd/scripts/collective-sync.sh
```

### Automated (Heartbeat Integration)

Add to each instance's `HEARTBEAT.md`:

```markdown
## Step 3: Then Check

AFTER completing work, do a 30-second health check:
- Run collective sync: `bash /home/agent/clawd/scripts/collective-sync.sh`
- Errors in logs? → Fix or report to Matthew
- Pending PRs/messages? → Address them
```

Or call it directly in soul scripts.

### Git Setup (Already Done!)

The clawd git repo is already syncing for each instance — **no extra setup needed**.

Each instance:
- Runs on its own branch (`master`, `markets`, `dev`, etc.)
- Commits digest to `collective/[branch]-digest.md`
- Fetches from origin to read other branches' digests
- No merge conflicts (each branch owns its own files)

## Creating Handoffs

When one instance needs another to do something, write a handoff file on your branch:

```bash
# From Markets instance (on 'markets' branch)
mkdir -p /home/agent/clawd/collective/handoffs

echo "## Task: Fix exit logic bug

Found issue in \`exit_position()\` - missing liquidity fallback for market 1269693.

**Details:**
- Error: \"Insufficient liquidity\"
- Code: src/position_manager.py:234
- Reproduce: Try exiting pos when liquidity < 1%

**Acceptance:**
- Add fallback for low-liquidity exits
- Test with mock market data
- Create PR

**Context:**
Markets digest from 2026-01-30 20:15 shows position stuck.
" > /home/agent/clawd/collective/handoffs/to-dev.md

git add collective/handoffs/to-dev.md
git commit -m "collective: Handoff to Dev - exit logic bug"
git push origin markets
```

The Dev instance will see this via `git show origin/markets:collective/handoffs/to-dev.md` on its next sync.

After addressing, Dev can delete it or Markets can remove it once resolved.

## Customizing Digests

Edit the `write_digest()` function in `collective-sync.sh` for your instance:

```bash
case "$INSTANCE" in
    master)
        echo "- 💬 Active in main chat"
        echo "- 🔄 Coordinating tasks"
        # Add custom logic here
        ;;
    markets)
        echo "- 📊 Trading monitoring active"
        # Pull real-time bot stats
        WALLET=$(bash scripts/railway-api.sh logs prod 10 | grep LIVE)
        echo "- 💰 $WALLET"
        ;;
esac
```

## Sync Frequency

**Recommended:**
- **Markets:** Every heartbeat (5 min) — real-time trading data
- **Core:** Every 2-3 heartbeats (4-6 min) — coordination updates
- **Dev:** Every 4-5 heartbeats (8-10 min) — PR/code status
- **Research:** Every 5-6 heartbeats (10-12 min) — findings/analysis

Balance between staying informed and avoiding noise.

## Reading Protocol

Instances only read digests updated in the **last hour** to avoid stale info.

If a digest is older than 1 hour, it's skipped (that instance may be offline or idle).

## Bulletin Board View

The aggregated bulletin shows all instances' status in one place:

```markdown
# Vroth Collective Bulletin Board
**Last updated:** 2026-01-30 20:20 UTC by Markets

---

## [Core]
*Last updated: 2026-01-30 20:18*

- 💬 Active in main chat
- 🔄 Coordinating tasks across instances
- ✅ No urgent issues

## [Markets]
*Last updated: 2026-01-30 20:20*

- 💰 LIVE WALLET: $559 | Open: 1/30
- 📝 PAPER: $17k (+70%)
- ✅ No critical alerts

## [Dev]
*Last updated: 2026-01-30 20:15*

- 🔧 Working on PR #42 (exit logic fix)
- ✅ No urgent fixes needed

---

**Handoffs:** See `handoffs/` for tasks tagged to specific instances

- ⚠️  `to-dev` (exit logic bug)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Digests Concise
- 3-5 bullet points max
- Use emojis for visual scanning (💰📊✅🚨)
- Focus on **actionable** info, not process

### 2. Tag Relevance
- Mark items `@all` if every instance should see it
- Mark items `@Dev`, `@Markets` etc. if targeted
- Use handoffs for specific requests

### 3. Delete Stale Handoffs
- After addressing a handoff, delete the file
- Don't leave old tasks lingering

### 4. Monitor Bulletin
- Core should check bulletin regularly (coordination role)
- Others check when looking for cross-instance context

### 5. Don't Duplicate Group Chat
- Sync is for **structured knowledge**, not chat
- Use Telegram group for urgent coordination
- Use digests for persistent status

## Troubleshooting

### Digest not updating

**Check:**
1. Is collective-sync.sh running during heartbeats?
2. Is the shared volume mounted? `ls /home/agent/projects/shared`
3. Are there write permission issues?

### Other instances not seeing my updates

**Check:**
1. Did you commit and push? `git log -1 collective/`
2. Did push succeed? `git status` (should say "up to date")
3. Can others fetch? Run `git fetch origin` on other instance
4. Check remote: `git show origin/your-branch:collective/your-digest.md`

### Too much noise / irrelevant updates

**Solution:**
- Increase sync frequency (check less often)
- Filter digests in read_digests() function
- Use handoffs for targeted communication only

## Example Integration

In Markets instance's HEARTBEAT.md:

```markdown
## Step 2: Do the Work

Monitor arb bot, check P&L, scan opportunities

## Step 3: Then Check

1. Run collective sync: `bash /home/agent/clawd/scripts/collective-sync.sh`
2. Check for dev handoffs (if exit logic bugs found)
3. Check arb bot logs for errors
4. Update digest if major changes

## Step 4: Report

Report findings to group + update digest
```

**The result:** Each instance stays informed without being overwhelmed. Signal, not noise. 🐉
